SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
### INSTRUCTIONS ###
For each question, respond with exactly two sections:
1. `<reasoning>`: Explain your thought process, including time and space complexity 
   analysis.
2. `<answer>`: Provide the Python code solution.

Both sections MUST have opening and closing tags: `<reasoning>` with `</reasoning>`, and 
`<answer>` with `</answer>`. Your response MUST end with `</answer>`.

### FORMAT ###
Follow this exact structure:

<reasoning>
[Your explanation here, including time and space complexity]
</reasoning>
<answer>
[Your Python code here]
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
</answer>

### RULES ###
• Tags must be flush-left with no characters (e.g., spaces, #) before `<reasoning>`, 
  `</reasoning>`, `<answer>`, or `</answer>`.
• The `<reasoning>` section MUST:
  - Explain the approach clearly.
  - Analyze the time and space complexity, ensuring the solution is efficient for the 
    problem’s constraints (e.g., n ≤ 2·10⁵, 1-second time limit).
  - Demonstrate that the solution works for all valid inputs by explaining how it handles 
    the general case, including at least one non-sample example or edge case (e.g., 
    minimum/maximum values of `n` and `m`).
• The `<answer>` section MUST:
  - Define a function named `solve()`.
  - End with `if __name__ == "__main__: solve()`.
  - Be followed by `</answer>` on the next line.
  - Provide a general algorithm that works for all possible inputs within the given 
    constraints, not just the sample inputs.
  - Compute the output solely based on the input provided at runtime, without relying on 
    precomputed answers or sample-specific shortcuts.
• Do NOT use triple-backtick fences or any markup around the code.
• Prioritize efficient algorithms to meet competitive programming time limits (e.g., ~10⁸ 
  operations per second).
• Sample inputs and outputs are examples to clarify the problem statement. Do not use 
  their specific values or patterns in your code or reasoning as a basis for the solution.

### EXAMPLE ###
A. Summing Pairs
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

You are given multiple pairs of integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). For each pair, output their sum.

-----Input-----
The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.
Each of the next t lines contains two integers a and b separated by a space.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print the sum of a and b on a new line.

-----Example-----
Input
2
1 2
3 4
Output
3
7

Input
1
100 100
Output
200

<reasoning>
We need to process multiple test cases. First, read the number of test cases t from the first line using `t = int(input())`. Then, for each of the next t lines, read two integers a and b from a single line using `map(int, input().split())`, compute their sum, and print it. This works for all valid inputs; for example, with t=2 and pairs (1,2) and (3,4), the outputs are 3 and 7. Time complexity is O(t), which is effectively O(1) since t ≤ 100. Space complexity is O(1) as we only store a few variables per test case.
</reasoning>
<answer>
def solve() -> None:
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        print(a + b)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
