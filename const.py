### INSTRUCTIONS ###
For each question, respond with exactly two sections:
1. `<reasoning>`: Explain your thought process, including time and space complexity 
   analysis.
2. `<answer>`: Provide the Python code solution.

Both sections MUST have opening and closing tags: `<reasoning>` with `</reasoning>`, and 
`<answer>` with `</answer>`. Your response MUST end with `</answer>`.

### FORMAT ###
Follow this exact structure:

<reasoning>
[Your explanation here, including time and space complexity]
</reasoning>
<answer>
[Your Python code here]
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
</answer>

### RULES ###
• Tags must be flush-left with no characters (e.g., spaces, #) before `<reasoning>`, 
  `</reasoning>`, `<answer>`, or `</answer>`.
• The `<reasoning>` section MUST:
  - Explain the approach clearly.
  - Analyze the time and space complexity, ensuring the solution is efficient for the 
    problem’s constraints (e.g., n ≤ 2·10⁵, 1-second time limit).
  - Demonstrate that the solution works for all valid inputs by explaining how it handles 
    the general case, including at least one non-sample example or edge case (e.g., 
    minimum/maximum values of `n` and `m`).
• The `<answer>` section MUST:
  - Define a function named `solve()`.
  - End with `if __name__ == "__main__: solve()`.
  - Be followed by `</answer>` on the next line.
  - Provide a general algorithm that works for all possible inputs within the given 
    constraints, not just the sample inputs.
  - Compute the output solely based on the input provided at runtime, without relying on 
    precomputed answers or sample-specific shortcuts.
• Do NOT use triple-backtick fences or any markup around the code.
• Prioritize efficient algorithms to meet competitive programming time limits (e.g., ~10⁸ 
  operations per second).
• Sample inputs and outputs are examples to clarify the problem statement. Do not use 
  their specific values or patterns in your code or reasoning as a basis for the solution.

### EXAMPLE ###
A. Summing Pairs
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

You are given multiple pairs of integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). For each pair, output their sum.

-----Input-----
The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.
Each of the next t lines contains two integers a and b separated by a space.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print the sum of a and b on a new line.

-----Example-----
Input
2
1 2
3 4
Output
3
7

Input
1
100 100
Output
200

<reasoning>
We need to process multiple test cases. First, read the number of test cases t from the first line using `t = int(input())`. Then, for each of the next t lines, read two integers a and b from a single line using `map(int, input().split())`, compute their sum, and print it. This works for all valid inputs; for example, with t=2 and pairs (1,2) and (3,4), the outputs are 3 and 7. Time complexity is O(t), which is effectively O(1) since t ≤ 100. Space complexity is O(1) as we only store a few variables per test case.
</reasoning>
<answer>
def solve() -> None:
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        print(a + b)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
</answer>

SYSTEM_SOL = """
    You are a senior competitive-programming tutor creating a solution for a Codeforces 
    problem.
    
    IMPORTANT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
    
    1. Write ONLY Python code with NO markdown formatting, NO code fences/backticks,
       and NO explanatory text.
    2. DO NOT start with ```python or any other code block indicators.
    3. Start your response DIRECTLY with the Python code itself.
    4. End your response with the final line of code - add no summary or conclusion.

    CODE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
    
    1. Your solution MUST include a function named 'solve()' that contains the main 
       solution logic.
    2. The `solve()` function MUST be called from within an `if __name__ == '__main__'` 
       block.
    3. Your code must correctly read from standard input and write to standard output.
    4. Include detailed comments explaining your approach and key steps.
    5. Ensure your solution handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the 
       problem.
    6. Use efficient algorithms and data structures appropriate for the problem 
       constraints.
    
    Your code will be automatically executed against test cases, so it must be 
    syntactically correct and follow the exact output format specified in the problem 
    statement.

SYSTEM_TEST_CASES = """
    You are an expert competitive-programming coach.

    For the Codeforces problem in the next message, generate a set of *adversarial* 
    test files that break naive solutions.

    Return **only** the following:

    SAMPLES = [
        # each element is (stdin, expected-stdout)
        (
            '''
            <full stdin for one test, with newlines exactly as fed to the program>
            ''',
            '''
            <exact stdout the correct solution must print>
            '''
        ),
        ...
    ]
    
     **Important:** Start by including the sample inputs and outputs exactly as provided 
     in the problem description. These samples are essential for verifying the 
     correctness of the solution. Then, generate additional adversarial test cases that 
     could break naive solutions. Ensure that the total number of tuples in `SAMPLES` is 
     at most 7, prioritizing the inclusion of the provided samples. Make sure to include 
     all provided samples verbatim; do not modify them or generate similar ones.

    Rules
    1.  Use triple-quoted Python string literals (`\"\"\" … \"\"\"`). Do *not* put 
        backslash-escaped `\n` inside them.
    2.  Each literal should **start and end on its own line** and contain a trailing 
        newline (`\n`) at the end of the block, because that is what the real judge’s 
        files look like.
    3.  Do not write anything outside the required block.
    4.  **Indentation rule** – inside the `SAMPLES` list every line (including the 
        opening/closing triple quotes) must be indented by exactly four spaces, no 
        more and no less.
    5.  Limit: generate **at most 7 tuples**; pick the most diverse / hardest cases — 
        do not list every permutation.
    6. Include all sample inputs and outputs provided in the problem description exactly 
        as they are, without modification. These must be the first tuples in the 
        `SAMPLES` list.

    Example: for the problem:
    
    A. Letters Cyclic Shift
    time limit per test: time limit per test 1 second
    memory limit per test: memory limit per test 256 megabytes

    You are given a non-empty string s consisting of lowercase English letters. You have to pick exactly one non-empty substring of s and shift all its letters ' z ' ' y ' ' x ' ' b ' ' a ' ' z '. In other words, each character is replaced with the previous character of English alphabet and ' a ' is replaced with ' z '.

    What is the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s by performing this shift exactly once?

    -----Input-----

    The only line of the input contains the string s ( 1 ≤ | s | ≤ 100 000 ) consisting of lowercase English letters.

    -----Output-----

    Print the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s by shifting letters of exactly one non-empty substring.

    -----Example-----
    Input
    codeforces
    Output
    bncdenqbdr

    Input
    abacaba
    Output
    aaacaba

    -----Note-----
    String s is lexicographically smaller than some other string t of the same length if there exists some 1 ≤ i ≤ | s | , such that s 1 = t 1 , s 2 = t 2 , ..., s i - 1 = t i - 1 , and s i < t i .
